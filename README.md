# FirstStep Web Application
# Your First Step Toward a Professional Career

FirstStep is a personal web application I developed to help users create professional CVs through a simple, guided process. Designed for students, graduates, and job seekers at all levels, FirstStep allows users to generate clean, structured résumés that are ready to download and share with employers.

The platform provides a secure, account-based system where users can log in to manage their information and update their CVs anytime. Through a user-friendly interface, individuals can enter personal details, education, work experience, skills, and more. A real-time preview updates as the user types, making the process intuitive and fast.

FirstStep ensures every CV has a polished look by offering a clean layout and print-ready format. By focusing on usability and simplicity, it eliminates the stress of formatting and lets users focus on what matters: presenting their qualifications clearly and professionally.
